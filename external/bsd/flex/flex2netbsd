# Rough instructions for importing new flex release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/flex/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/flex/dist/flex2netbsd flex-2.5.x `pwd`
#	$ cd src/external/bsd/flex/dist
#	$ cvs import -m "Import flex 2.5.x" src/external/bsd/flex/dist FLEX flex-2-5-x
#	$ cd ../../../../../flex-9.x.y
#	$ run ./configure
#	$ run make
#	check the config file and copy it to /usr/src/external/bsd/flex/include
#	check the manual page against our copy if there are new options and
#	update
