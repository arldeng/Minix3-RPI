.Dt MI_VECTOR_HASH 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mi_vector_hash
.Nd fast 32bit hash functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft void
.Fn mi_vector_hash "const void * restrict key" "size_t len" \
    "uint32_t seed" "uint32_t hashes[3]"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function computes three 32-bit hash values of the memory area starting at
.Fa key
with length
.Fa len .
.Pp
The output is identical on all architectures and only depends on
.Fa key
and
.Fa seed .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
An optimised code path is used if
.Fa key
is aligned on a 32-bit boundary.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The hash function has been created by Bob Jenkins.
