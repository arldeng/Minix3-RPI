svrctl \- special server control functions

#include <sys/svrctl.h>

int svrctl(u32_t \fIrequest\fP, void *\fIdata\fP);
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Svrctl
implements some very MINIX 3 specific system calls that don't deserve their own
system call number.
.PP
This system call makes it easy to add new ways of setting and getting system
parameters, but at the same time, backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
Read the <sys/svrctl.h> include file to see what the structures mentioned below
look like.  Most calls are root-only, unless specified otherwise.
.PP
The only way to know how to properly use these calls is to study the
associated server code, or the programs that already use these
calls.
.PP
Current requests are:
.TP 5
.B MMGETPARAM
Request the value of one or all boot parameters.  Can be used by non-root.
.TP
.B MMSETPARAM
Set an override for a value of a boot parameter.  Can be used by non-root.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.B Svrctl
returns 0 upon success and -1 upon failure.
