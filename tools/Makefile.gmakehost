# Rules used when building a GNU host package.  Expects MODULE to be set.
# This version runs ${TOOL_GMAKE} instead of ${MAKE}
#
# There's not a lot we can do to build reliably in the face of many
# available configuration options.  To be as low-overhead as possible,
# we follow the following scheme:
#
# * Configuration is only re-run when an autoconf source file (such as
#   "configure" or "config.sub") is changed.
#
# * "config.status" is run to rebuild Makefiles and .h files if an
#   autoconf-parsed file (such as Makefile.in) is changed.
#
# * If MKUPDATE != "no", "make install" is only run if a build has happened
#   since the last install in the current directory.
